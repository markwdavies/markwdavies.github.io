## For SQL Server

There are a few scripts to be found in my [github repo](https://github.com/markwdavies/SQLServerUtilities) that I use daily to help locate useful information on a SQL Server Database Server.

Additionally there are numerous websites out there offering advice and scripts to the SQL Server DBA, of the many downloadable resources available these are some that I have found to be useful ...

***

* [Who Is Active](https://github.com/amachanic/sp_whoisactive)
     * Adam Mechanic's essential addition to sp_who2 to show the current active processes.

* [Brent Ozar's First Responder Kit](https://www.brentozar.com/first-aid/) 
    * An Invaluable set of scripts for gathering diagnostic data. 
    * See also the extensive blog posts on the site.

* [Ola Hallengren's Maintenance solution](https://ola.hallengren.com) 
    * A SQL Server Maintenance Solution that is quick to get up and running ! 
    * I don't know a quicker way to set up a backup solution , but be wary when enabling the indexing jobs without tweaking the parameters.
    
* [SQL Undercover](https://sqlundercover.com/free-tools/) 
    * sp_RestoreScript is a very handy resource to generate DB restore commands.
    * many other scripts in a github repository - see also the blog posts.
