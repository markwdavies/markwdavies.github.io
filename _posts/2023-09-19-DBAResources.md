There are a few scripts in my [github repo](https://github.com/markwdavies/SQLServerUtilities) that I've found handy to use daily to help locate useful information on a SQL Server Database Server.
Additionally there are numerous websites out there offering advice and scripts to the SQL Server DBA, of the many downloadable resources available these are some that I have found to be useful ...

***

* [Brent Ozar's First Responder Kit](https://www.brentozar.com/first-aid/) 
    * An Invaluable set of scripts for gathering diagnostic data. 
    * See also the extensive blog posts on the site.
* [Ola Hallengren's Maintenance solution](https://ola.hallengren.com) 
    * A SQL Server Maintenance Solution that is quick to get up and running ! 
    * I don't know a quicker way to set up a backup solution , but be wary when enabling the indexing jobs without tweaking the parameters.
* [SQL Undercover](https://sqlundercover.com/free-tools/) 
    * sp_RestoreScript is a very handy resource to generate DB restore commands 
    * many other scripts in a github repository - see also the blog posts.
